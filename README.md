**Project Description:**

Explore the intricacies of odometry error analysis in robotic systems with this comprehensive project. Our endeavor aims to dissect and understand the nuances contributing to inaccuracies in determining a robot's position relative to its starting point.

**Introduction:**
Odometry, pivotal for measuring wheel rotation via encoders, serves as the bedrock for precise position estimation in robotics. However, inherent challenges such as sensor discrepancies, wheel slippage, and surface dynamics often introduce errors. This project endeavors to unravel these complexities, paving the path towards improved odometry accuracy.

**Data Collection:**
Central to our investigation is the meticulous collection of odometry data and ground truth references for comparison. Leveraging the robot's '/odom' topic and laser scans with a wall as a reference point, we procure essential datasets. Rigorous preprocessing, including data cleaning and redundancy elimination, ensures the integrity of our analysis.

**Analysis:**
Our analysis journey commences with data visualization, illuminating patterns and trends within the collected datasets. Correlation analysis unveils the intricate relationships between error metrics and robot attributes. Through advanced techniques like feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we decipher primary factors influencing odometry errors.

**KNN Classifier:**
Harnessing the power of machine learning, we employ a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) classifier to categorize distance traveled errors based on identified attributes. This classification furnishes invaluable insights into error occurrence patterns, empowering targeted error mitigation strategies.

**Conclusion & Future Work:**
Our exploration underscores the profound impact of motion duration and robot type on odometry accuracy. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes the development of real-time error mitigation tools, such as adaptive self-calibration mechanisms fueled by collected data. This repository stands as a testament to our commitment to unraveling odometry intricacies and driving advancements in robotic navigation.

Embark on this journey with us as we delve into the realms of odometry error analysis, laying the groundwork for future breakthroughs in robotic positioning precision.
